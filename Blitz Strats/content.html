-About Blitz
World of Tanks Blitz is a mobile and pc game simulating tank combat with 8 different nations and over 370+ vehicles. Tanks in Blitz have a set hitpoint pool, it is decreased each time a shot penetrates the vehicle and your vehicle is destoryed when it is depleted. There are 4 main tank classes including Light Tanks, Medium Tanks, Heavy Tanks, and Tank Destroyers. Each nation has a different tech tree consisting of the tank classes. There are in total 10 tiers of tanks, starting from tier I to tier X. To research new tanks, play more battles to earn CombatXP and Credits to buy the researched tanks. Blitz is filled with different games modes and seasonal events, there are also may different bundles and crates for new players to join easily.

-Basic knowledge
The Tank Survivability Onion shows the different circumstances considered by real military tank crews to help them survive an engagement. In Blitz, all of these parametesrs are similated with different levels of realism.

-Don't be there
Having good situational awareness is key in tank combat and knowing your role on the team and the strengths of your tank will help you achieve this.
    -Light Tanks
    Light tanks are small and mobile. They have good spotting ranges (more on spotting range in Don't be seen) and relatively quick reloads. Light tanks are good at getting into position fast and spotting enemy tanks before they can get into cover. Your role in a light tank is to spot enemies for your team and get into cover letting the heavy tanks take the shots. Light tanks are also great at flanking because of their fast speeds. When your team is at a hault unable to push through enemy lines, flank behind the enemy and engange them from behind. When the enemy turns around to face you, drive back into cover and let your team take advantage of your manuever.

    -Medium Tanks
    Medium tanks also have great mobility. They have descent spotting range and can also get into position quickly. The main role of medium tanks are to support the light and heavy tanks. After the enemies are spotted by the light tanks, get to the sides of the enemy while the heavy tanks draw the fire. Distract the enemy and make them turn towards you, exposing their sides to the rest of the team. Mediums also have some degree of armor protection, allowing you to work ridgelines and take advantage of terrain irregularities (more on engagement tactis in Don't be hit).

    -Heavy Tanks
    Heavy tanks have excellent armor protection. They have reletaively worse mobility, but the better armor and fire power makes up for it. Your role as a heavy tank is to take shots for the team and utilize the large hitpoint pools carried by most heavies (more on defensive tactics in Don't be penetrated). Heavy tanks are very team dependent and fall apart quickly when flanked by mobile lights and mediums. Stick to the rest of the heavies and follow the mobile teammates when possible. 

    -Tank Destroyers
    Tank Destroyers are the equivalent of snipers in tank combat. They have massive fire power and can harshly punish enemies for mistakes. Although some tank destroyers are also heavily armored, most aren't. Your role in the team is to support and cover the rest of the team from a far advantage point without taking shots (more on concealment in Don't be seen). Because of their great fire power, they also have a slow reload, making them extremely vulnerable to flanking attacks. Stick to the team when they push and don't get left behind.

Knowing what each tank type specializes in will help you support the team and win more battles, but understanding how to properly execute their roles will require more knowledge about map features and concealment.

-Don't be seen
    -Spotting
    Spotting is a key mechanic of Blitz and remaining concealed while spotting enemies will give you a major advantage. Rather than actually seeing the enemies, they will be spotted automatically when they are in a specific range of you and there is a direct line of sight. A yellow lightbulb will appear above your tank when you are spotted after 3 seconds. Each vehicle in Blitz has a different Camouflage Rating and it also changes depending on what the vehicle is doing. The vehicle is the most stealth rating decreases in order of the following actions of Staying staionary, Moving, and Shooting. Holding off shots for the appropriate time and backing into cover immediately after shooting will prevent unneccesary bleeding of hitpoints. Equiping camouflages in the hangar will also increase you stealth by 3%.

    -Positioning
    Utalizing map features are also key in preventing being spotted in Blitz. Bushes will increase your camouflage rating by a significant amount and you will never be spotted if the enemy is also hiding behind a bush. Poking a bush can let you get shots off before the enemy even spots what shot them (more on poking in Don't be hit). Rocks and hills or other obstructions can also prevent you from being spotted. Without a line of sight, tanks will never be spotted no matter how close they are to each other.

    Although these tactics can hide you from the enemy in a lot of situations, eventually being spotted will be inevitable as the battle goes on. Knowing what to do after being spotted is also key in surviving an engagement.

-Don't be hit
    -Cover
    If enemy shells can't connect with your vehicle, there is no chance of penetration except for explosive shells (more on shell types in Don't be penetrated), but the damage of nonconnecting explosives are usually neglectable. One of the greates tactics of not being hit is to just hide behind cover. It is easy to see tanks as aggresive machines at the spearhead of the charge cutting through enemy lines, that however does not hold true when fighting against enemy tanks. If you expose yourself in enemy fire, your vehicle will be easily targetted and taken apart quickly. 

    -Poking
    The tactic of taking a shot and immediately backing into cover to reload the gun is called poking. Poking allows you to take shots when necessary while staying mostly in cover. This tactic works best for tanks with strong turret armor and combined with hills or slopes, your vehicle might become completely inpennetrable to the enemy (more on hull-down in Don't be penetrated). 

    It is important to note however that being too passive will also cost your team the victory and knowing when to push will become more obvious the more battles played.

-Don't be penetrated
    -Shell Type
    To understand how to defend your vehicle from enemy shells, we must first learn what each shell type is capable of. In Blitz there are 5 major shell types: AP (Armor Piercing), APCR (Armor Piercing Composite Rigid), HEAT (High Explosive Anti Tank), HE (High Explosive), HESH (High Explosive Squash Head). 

        -Penetrator shells
        AP, APCR, and HEAT are penetrators that deal damage only if the shell penetrates a vehicle. In Blitz, this is indicated by the red overlay while in scope mode. The more red an area is, the lower the chance of penetrating. Common weak spots on tanks are the turret cheeks, lower plate, and generally the side and rear of vehicles. 

        AP is the standard shell for most tanks in low and mid tiers, it has great normalization meaning it does well against angeled armor, although any angle above 70 degress will result in an auto ricochet bouncing the shell off and usually doing no damage. 

        APCR is the premium ammo in lower tiers and standard in higher tiers, it has greater shell velocity than AP and usually greater penetration but worse shell normalization and it's penetrating capabilities drastically reduce with distance. 

        HEAT shells are premium ammo for higher tier tanks. They have extremely good penetration that stays constant at all ranges, but also ignite on contact meaning it will have similar downsides to HE shells (more on HE below).

        -Explosive shells
        HE and HESH are explosive shells that deal splash damage, meaning the shells just have to explode within the vicinity of penetrable armor. In Blitz, this is indicated by red and yellow overlay in scope mode. Red areas mean the shells don't have enough explosive power to do damage to the tank. Yellow areas mean the shells will not penetrate, but will do splash damage. Generally, HE shells have drastically lower penetration than penetrators and if there are no transparent spots that HE shells can penetrate, firing explosive shells will only result in lower damage.
        
        HE is extremely different from AP and APCR. Instead of just penetrating a vehicle, HE shells have explosives packed within them, meaning if the shell penetrates a lot more damage will be dealt. However, HE ammo explodes on contact and can be stopped by obstacles such as fences or walls and can be easily defeated by spaced armor on some vehicles. 

        HESH ammo are specialized explosives shells available for only British high tier vehicles. They still have less penetration than penetrator shells, but have significantly more than conventional explosive shells.

    Note: All 5 of these ammo type are modeled after real life tank ammunitions developed from the begining of tanks to War World II. The summaries above only describes their mechanics in Blitz and more detail on them can be found on their respective wiki pages.

    -Armor Handling
    Although most tanks have great armor protection, there are still many weak spots that the enemy can take advantage of. Tactis to hide these spots include angling, hull-down, side scraping, and wiggling. 

        -Angling
        Typically, tanks have the strongest armor in the front, weaker on the sides, and the weakest in the rear. When facing enemy tanks, always turn your vehicle towards them and angle slightly to either left or right. This maximizes the effective armor thickness of your whole vehicle because the steeper an armor plate is, the harder it is to penetrate. 

        -Hull down
        To position yourself in a hull-down situation, find hills or ridgelines to hide behind and slowly drive forwards stopping when you have a clear shot over the terrain. This only exposes your turret and angles the armor slightly upwards increasing its effective thickness. Combined with poking, this strategy can be extremely effective with a tank that has great turret armor and barrel depression.

        -Side scraping
        To side scrap, find a obstacle large enough to hide your tank and drive behind it. Then, turn slightly away from the clearing and start backing up. Stop when you have a clear shot and make sure the front of your tank is still behind the obstacle. This places your tank at an extremely steep angle for the enemy and allows you to get shots of without being fired back at.

        -Wiggling
        Although the frontal parts of tanks are strong, there are still weak spots such as the lower plate, turret cheeks, and hatches. To make these spots a harder target for the enemy, simply wiggle your tank back and forth and turn the turret randomly.


    Hopefully by exploring the survivability onion, you learned more about Blitz and tank combat in general. Combined with enough practice, winning victories will be significantly easier and a lot less frustrating.
